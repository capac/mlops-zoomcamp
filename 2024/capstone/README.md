# MLOps Zoomcamp Capstone Project

The dataset employed in this MLOps Zoomcamp project is the [Higher Education Students Performance Evaluation dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/856/higher+education+students+performance+evaluation "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/856/higher+education+students+performance+evaluation") from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Additional Information

The data was collected from the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Educational Sciences students in 2019. The purpose is to predict students' end-of-term performances using ML techniques. The dataset includes 145 instances in 31 features. The first ten features of the data regard personal questions, features 11 to 16 regard family questions, and the remaining features are about education habits. The dataset doesn't contain missing values.

The paper derived from the dataset is [Student Performance Classification Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d2540a82aea0f5acef91c8b4f92295ff8f312404 "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d2540a82aea0f5acef91c8b4f92295ff8f312404").
