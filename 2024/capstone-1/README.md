# MLOps Zoomcamp Capstone Project

The dataset employed in this MLOps Zoomcamp project is the [Algerian Forest Fires dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/547/algerian+forest+fires+dataset "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/547/algerian+forest+fires+dataset") from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Additional Information

The dataset includes 244 instances that regroup data from two regions of Algeria, namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria. There are 122 data entires for each region, and the period of the data collection goes from June 2012 to September 2012. The dataset includes 11 feature attributes and 1 output attribute. The output feature has been classified into 138 `fire` classes and 106 `not fire` classes. The dataset doesn't contain missing values.

The main paper from the dataset is ["Predicting Forest Fire in Algeria Using Data Mining Techniques: Case Study of the Decision Tree Algorithm"](https://rdcu.be/doIk7 "https://rdcu.be/doIk7"), by Faroudja Abid and N.Izeboudjen.
